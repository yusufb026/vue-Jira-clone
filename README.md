## Inspiration and Why? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm a Full Stack Web developer and an open source collaborator that just love building things üòâ

This project is basically a clone of another open source Jira clone build in React ( clone of a clone i know üòµ) [here's the link to the repo](https://github.com/oldboyxx/jira_clone). it's a brilliant example of a React codebase done right, but since im a Vuejs developer i had the idea of rebuilding the app with the same functionalities but using Vue instead and i though it would be a great opportunity to explore the new composition api coming to Vue very soon. and since we are doing a full rewrite i added graphql to the mix.

I belive that this project will be a great example for Vuejs developers in the future transitioning from the old Vue api to the new composition api or for Vuejs newcomers in general.
